Megaram Padmavati
The Process of application, approval and disbursal was quick. The Loan officer
created a customized solution for my specific needs. You made the process of
getting a loan simple - right from documentation to disbursal and it hence saved
a lot of my time.
Abhishek Jain
Your variety of loan products available made it easier for small businessmen like
me with the usual ups and down of income, to operate and grow my business
profitably with options that cater to every need. HDB turned to be the best
choice after all.
